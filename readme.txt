This plugin adds a feature to NextCellent Gallery to add an image from the WP Media Library.

== Description ==

If you use NextCellent Gallery, then you know that, when you create a gallery, you must upload the images for that gallery, which is then stored in a separate folder from your WordPress Media Library.

Now, with this NextCellent Gallery Media Library Addon, you will have the option of adding images that are already stored in your Media Library. Just like adding an image to a page or post, adding an image to your NextCellent Gallery can be a matter of clicking a button and finding an image you have already uploaded.

This plugin is a fork of [NextGEN Gallery Media Library Addon](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery-media-library-addon/), updated to work with NextCellent.
